# Bayesian approach to forecasting revenues (EOTHO)
This project was completed in conjunction with my masters' in applied statistics. Here is the abstract:

How will a new product perform in a new market? This is a core concern for commercial firms as information on this will affect product and marketing strategy, amongst other decisions. 

For players in the motion picture industry, making accurate forecasts about the performance of a movie upon release is crucial at key stages of the movie-production process. In this project, I consider the use of two approaches - a Bayesian framework and a statistical learning approach - to forecast movie revenues. I evaluate the accuracy of the forecasts for the different methods and consider how the strengths of each approach can be used to address the forecasting needs of motion picture companies as they seek the right strategy throughout the movie-production process. From my analysis, I find that that the random forest algorithm produces very accurate revenue forecasts for both countries. The Bayesian model also fairs well and is a formidable alternative to the random forest model if interpretability of the model is of importance.
